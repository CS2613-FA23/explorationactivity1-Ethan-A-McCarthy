# ExplorationActivity1
## 1 Package:
The package that I am exploring in this assignment is the Pandas Package for Python and this program demonstrates simple usage of the package and analyze a comma separated value file. We can parse data and do various different things using the Pandas package and it is a very popular package in the data analysis field for this reason. 
## 2 How do you run this program? 
You would run this program as you would any other python progam. Download the .py file and navigate to the folder path and then execute the file. Since it is a very simple program there is no user input or any other actions nessacary however, you could modify the program for many other datasets very quickly. 
## 3 What is the purpose of the program?
The purpose of this program is to parse through global salary data and explore the capabilities of the Pandas package
## 4 Sample input/output:
To input new datasets you would have to change the code itself however the output is: The salaries unchanged, the countries that have a median salary of over 4000$, the average salary of each continent, the top 5 highest salaries and what countries they come from, and then the top 3 highest salaries per continent.
Ex. 
Average salary of each continent:
|continent_name|
|-------------------------------|
|Africa               772.719863|
|Asia                1727.657722|
|Caribbean           1617.098333|
|Central America     1892.721250|
|Europe              3576.279912|
|North America       2647.316667|
|Northern America    5221.610000|
|Oceania             1946.011667|
|South America       1526.053077|
